<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Sukhchain Singh and I'm an Artist, Programmer and a PixelArtist.
I started programming with Java in my 10th class, hoping that I would make a game. 
That hope was hopless to begin with since I didn't had a computer at that time and was 
learning on my low end smartphone. When I got in college I learned everything from C to C# 
with passion, made small projects, got into graphics programming, participated in few coding competitions
and won 1st prize 2 times. By the end of my college life I had experience in embedded, web,
desktop and game development, the only thing I wanted to try but couldn't because of the 
lack of poweful hardware was android development. I learnt a lot from my college about life,
loss and the power of friendship, without my college experience I would have remained that 
childish brat.
