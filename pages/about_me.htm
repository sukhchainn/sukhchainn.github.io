<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Sukhchain Singh and I'm a full time Android Developer at ClubMalwa.
I have interest in Anime, pixel art and programming and sometimes I make some memes.
I started programming when I was in high school, I learned HTML, CSS for 2 years 
slowly taking my time, I didn't consider Web Dev as a good carrer so I spent my time
more on other skills and Java, hoping that I would make a game. That hope was hopless
to begin with since I didn't had a computer at that time and was learning on my low 
end smartphone. When I got in college I learned everything from C to C# with passion, 
made small projects, got into graphics programming, participated in few coding competitions
and won 1st prize 2 times. By the end of my college life I had experience in embedded, web,
desktop and game development, the only thing I wanted to try but couldn't because of the 
lack of poweful hardware was android development. I learnt a lot from my college about life,
loss and the power of friendship, without my college experience I would have remained that 
childish brat.
