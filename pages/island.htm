<h1>ISLAND</h1>
<p>
	ISLAND is my first software restoration project, I have made some small games in C
	language and Allegro framework but restoring an old text adventure game is more educational
	and a different experiance than just making a game. Extending upon an existing game long 
	after it's creators is like keeping a record of a legacy and making a legend out of it.

<h2>About</h2>
<p>
	I found ISLAND on textadventuregames.com before it got closed down, I wanted to play a
	text adventure game, I didn't even know what textadventure games were until I watched an
	episode of Legion (by SyFy) in which Dr. Melanie Bird become a text adventure game, after
	watching it I quickly searched for "text adventure games". The site I got was a repository
	of source code of text adventure and other DOS games. I thought that I was downloading an
	opensource version of SAGA Island game, but found out that it was from a different era. I
	still sometimes think about how much information is lost everyday, and it makes me be
	greatful for downloading the source code of one of the lost with time games.
