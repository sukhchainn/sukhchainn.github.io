		<h1>ISLAND</h1>
		<p>
			ISLAND is my first software restoration project, I have made some small games in C
			language and Allegro framework but restoring an old text adventure game is more educational
			and a different experiance than just making a game. Extending upon an existing game long 
			after it's creators is like keeping a record of a legacy and making a legend out of it.

		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>
			I found ISLAND on textadventuregames.com before it got closed down, I wanted to play a
			text adventure game, I didn't even know what textadventure games were until I watched an
			episode of Legion (by SyFy) in which Dr. Melanie Bird become a text adventure game, after
			watching it I quickly searched for "text adventure games". The site I got was a repository
			of source code of text adventure and other DOS games. I thought that I was downloading an
			opensource version of SAGA Island game, but found out that it was from a different era. I
			still sometimes think about how much information is lost everyday, and it makes me be
			greatful for downloading the source code of one of the lost with time games.
